# Survival Analysis

`gtregression` supports a complete survival workflow: describe the
cohort, draw Kaplan-Meier curves, summarise observed survival, compare
groups, fit Cox or parametric survival models, check assumptions,
predict survival probabilities, visualise estimates, and export
publication-ready tables.

``` r

library(gtregression)
library(dplyr)

data("data_lungcancer", package = "gtregression")

lung_data <- data_lungcancer |>
  mutate(
    trt = factor(trt, levels = c(1, 2),
                 labels = c("Standard treatment", "Test treatment")),
    prior = factor(prior, levels = c(0, 10), labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    celltype = factor(
      celltype,
      levels = c("squamous", "smallcell", "adeno", "large"),
      labels = c("Squamous", "Small cell", "Adenocarcinoma", "Large cell")
    )
  )

attr(lung_data$time, "label") <- "Survival time"
attr(lung_data$status, "label") <- "Death status"
attr(lung_data$trt, "label") <- "Treatment group"
attr(lung_data$celltype, "label") <- "Cancer cell type"
attr(lung_data$karno, "label") <- "Karnofsky performance score"
attr(lung_data$age, "label") <- "Age"
attr(lung_data$prior, "label") <- "Prior therapy"

surv_exposures <- c("trt", "celltype", "karno", "age", "prior")
```

## 1. Describe The Cohort

Start with a baseline table. This helps readers understand the treatment
groups before looking at survival curves or models.

``` r

lung_summary <- descriptive_table(
  data = lung_data,
  exposures = c("time", "status", "celltype", "karno", "age", "prior"),
  by = trt,
  statistic = c(time = "median", karno = "mean", age = "mean"),
  percent = column,
  show_overall = last
)

lung_summary$table
```

| Characteristic | Standard treatment, N=69 | Test treatment, N=68 | Overall, N=137 |
|----|----|----|----|
| Survival time | 97.0 (25.0-153.0) | 52.5 (24.8-117.2) | 80.0 (25.0-144.0) |
| Death status |  |  |  |
|  0 | 5 (7.2%) | 4 (5.9%) | 9 (6.6%) |
|  1 | 64 (92.8%) | 64 (94.1%) | 128 (93.4%) |
| Cancer cell type |  |  |  |
|  Squamous | 15 (21.7%) | 20 (29.4%) | 35 (25.5%) |
|  Small cell | 30 (43.5%) | 18 (26.5%) | 48 (35.0%) |
|  Adenocarcinoma | 9 (13.0%) | 18 (26.5%) | 27 (19.7%) |
|  Large cell | 15 (21.7%) | 12 (17.6%) | 27 (19.7%) |
| Karnofsky performance score | 59.2 (18.7) | 57.9 (21.4) | 58.6 (20.0) |
| Age | 57.5 (10.8) | 59.1 (10.3) | 58.3 (10.5) |
| Prior therapy |  |  |  |
|  No | 48 (69.6%) | 49 (72.1%) | 97 (70.8%) |
|  Yes | 21 (30.4%) | 19 (27.9%) | 40 (29.2%) |
| Categorical variables shown as n (%); percentages are by column. |  |  |  |
| Continuous summaries: time = Median (IQR); karno = Mean (SD); age = Mean (SD). |  |  |  |

## 2. Show Observed Survival

Use
[`km_plot()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/km_plot.md)
for the Kaplan-Meier curve. Add `risk_table = TRUE` when the number at
risk should appear under the curve. When survival remains high, use
`ylim` to focus the y-axis, for example `ylim = c(50, 100)` with the
default percentage scale. Confidence intervals are shown as shaded bands
when `conf.int = TRUE`.

``` r

km_curve <- km_plot(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  by = trt,
  break_time_by = 200,
  ylim = c(50, 100),
  title = "Kaplan-Meier Survival by Treatment"
)

km_curve
```

![](survival-analysis_files/figure-html/surv-km-plot-1.png)

For multi-panel publication figures, make each Kaplan-Meier plot lighter
and let `patchwork` arrange the panels. A common pattern is to remove
the risk table, use short panel titles, reduce `title_size`, and collect
legends across panels.

``` r

km_trt_panel <- km_plot(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  by = trt,
  risk_table = FALSE,
  break_time_by = 200,
  ylim = c(50, 100),
  title = "A. Treatment group",
  title_size = 10,
  title_face = plain,
  legend_position = bottom,
  base_size = 10
)

km_prior_panel <- km_plot(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  by = prior,
  risk_table = FALSE,
  break_time_by = 200,
  ylim = c(50, 100),
  title = "B. Prior therapy",
  title_size = 10,
  title_face = plain,
  legend_position = bottom,
  base_size = 10
)

patchwork::wrap_plots(km_trt_panel, km_prior_panel, ncol = 2) +
  patchwork::plot_layout(guides = "collect") &
  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

![](survival-analysis_files/figure-html/surv-km-panel-1.png)

Use table summaries when readers need exact survival values.

``` r

survival_summary(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  by = trt
)$table
```

| Group | N | Events | Censored | Median survival (95% CI) |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| Standard treatment | 69 | 64 | 5 | 103.0 (59.0-132.0) |
| Test treatment | 68 | 64 | 4 | 52.5 (44.0-95.0) |
| Median survival is estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Not reached means survival did not fall to 50% during observed follow-up. |  |  |  |  |

Kaplan-Meier survival summary {.table .cl-2094eab0
quarto-disable-processing="true"}

``` r

survival_prob(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  by = trt,
  times = c(90, 180, 365)
)$table
```

| Group | Time | At risk | Events | Censored | Survival probability (95% CI) |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Standard treatment | 90.0 | 37 | 31 | 1 | 54.7% (44.0%-67.9%) |
| Standard treatment | 180.0 | 13 | 21 | 3 | 21.2% (13.2%-34.1%) |
| Standard treatment | 365.0 | 4 | 8 | 1 | 7.1% (2.8%-18.0%) |
| Test treatment | 90.0 | 25 | 42 | 2 | 38.0% (28.0%-51.6%) |
| Test treatment | 180.0 | 14 | 9 | 1 | 23.3% (14.9%-36.3%) |
| Test treatment | 365.0 | 6 | 7 | 1 | 11.0% (5.3%-22.7%) |
| Survival probabilities are estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Events and censored counts are interval counts up to each requested time point. |  |  |  |  |  |

Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities {.table .cl-20b7ef4c
quarto-disable-processing="true"}

[`rmst_table()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/rmst_table.md)
reports restricted mean survival time up to a chosen follow-up time.
This is useful when an absolute survival-time summary is easier to
explain than a ratio measure.

``` r

rmst_table(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  by = trt,
  tau = 365
)$table
```

| Group | Tau | N | Events | RMST (95% CI) | RMST difference (95% CI) | p-value |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Standard treatment | 365.0 | 69 | 64 | 119.0 (93.5-144.5) |  |  |
| Test treatment | 365.0 | 68 | 64 | 112.4 (83.3-141.6) |  |  |
| Difference (Test treatment - Standard treatment) | 365.0 |  |  |  | -6.6 (-45.3-32.2) | 0.740 |
| RMST is restricted mean survival time up to tau. For two groups, the difference is the second group minus the first group. |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Restricted mean survival time {.table .cl-20e47f80
quarto-disable-processing="true"}

## 3. Compare Survival Curves

[`logrank_test()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/logrank_test.md)
compares Kaplan-Meier curves. It is a group comparison test, not an
effect-size model.

``` r

logrank_test(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  by = trt
)$table
```

| Group | N | Observed events | Expected events |
|----|----|----|----|
| Standard treatment | 69 | 64 | 64.50 |
| Test treatment | 68 | 64 | 63.50 |
| Log-rank test: chi-square = 0.01, df = 1, p-value = 0.928. This compares survival curves; use cox_reg() when a hazard ratio is needed. |  |  |  |

Log-rank test {.table .cl-210ba510 quarto-disable-processing="true"}

## 4. Fit Cox Regression

[`cox_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/cox_reg.md)
reports hazard ratios. Use `adjust_for` to produce adjusted hazard
ratios while keeping the syntax aligned with
[`multi_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/multi_reg.md).

``` r

cox_crude <- cox_reg(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  exposures = surv_exposures
)

cox_adjusted <- cox_reg(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  exposures = c(trt, celltype, prior),
  adjust_for = c(age, karno)
)

cox_adjusted$table
```

| Characteristic | Adjusted HR (95% CI) | p-value |
|----|----|----|
| Treatment group |  |  |
| Standard treatment | Ref. |  |
|  Test treatment | 1.21 (0.84–1.74) | 0.307 |
| Cancer cell type |  |  |
| Squamous | Ref. |  |
|  Small cell | 2.06 (1.26–3.39) | 0.004 |
|  Adenocarcinoma | 3.23 (1.82–5.74) | \<0.001 |
|  Large cell | 1.38 (0.80–2.37) | 0.244 |
| Prior therapy |  |  |
| No | Ref. |  |
|  Yes | 0.96 (0.64–1.42) | 0.820 |
| Abbreviations: HR = Hazard Ratio; CI = Confidence Interval. |  |  |
| Ref. = reference category. |  |  |
| Adjusted for Age and Karnofsky performance score |  |  |

Planned interactions use the same `interaction = exposure*modifier`
grammar as
[`multi_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/multi_reg.md).
In the default exposure-by-exposure workflow, supply the single exposure
you want to interpret.

``` r

cox_interaction <- cox_reg(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  exposures = trt,
  adjust_for = c(age, karno),
  interaction = trt*prior
)

cox_interaction$table
```

| Characteristic | Adjusted HR (95% CI) | p-value |
|----|----|----|
| Treatment group |  |  |
| Standard treatment | Ref. |  |
|  Test treatment | 1.52 (0.98–2.36) | 0.061 |
|  Treatment group: Test treatment x Prior therapy: Yes | 0.47 (0.21–1.06) | 0.070 |
| Abbreviations: HR = Hazard Ratio; CI = Confidence Interval. |  |  |
| Ref. = reference category. |  |  |
| Adjusted for Age and Karnofsky performance score |  |  |
| Model includes interaction term: trt\*prior |  |  |

Check the proportional hazards assumption before treating Cox hazard
ratios as final.

``` r

check_ph(cox_adjusted)$table
```

## 5. Fit Parametric Survival Regression

[`surv_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/surv_reg.md)
fits accelerated failure time style parametric survival models and
reports time ratios. A time ratio above 1 suggests longer survival time;
below 1 suggests shorter survival time, conditional on the selected
distribution.

Before choosing the final distribution, compare candidate parametric
models numerically and visually. Lower AIC/BIC is useful for screening;
the fitted curve should also look reasonable against the Kaplan-Meier
curve.

``` r

surv_model_compare(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  exposures = c(trt, celltype, prior),
  adjust_for = c(age, karno),
  distributions = c(weibull, exponential, "log-normal", "log-logistic")
)$table
```

| Distribution | AIC | BIC | Log-likelihood | Scale | N | Events | Best AIC | Best BIC |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| loglogistic | 1,441.93 | 1,468.21 | -711.96 | 0.58 | 137 | 128 | Yes | Yes |
| lognormal | 1,447.29 | 1,473.57 | -714.64 | 1.06 | 137 | 128 | No | No |
| exponential | 1,448.32 | 1,471.68 | -716.16 | 1.00 | 137 | 128 | No | No |
| weibull | 1,449.11 | 1,475.39 | -715.55 | 0.93 | 137 | 128 | No | No |
| Lower AIC or BIC indicates better relative fit among the compared distributions. Use model fit statistics with clinical judgment and visual checks. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Parametric survival model comparison {.table .cl-21db5922
quarto-disable-processing="true"}

``` r

plot_surv_fit(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  by = trt,
  adjust_for = c(age, karno),
  distributions = c(weibull, "log-logistic"),
  break_time_by = 200
)
```

![](survival-analysis_files/figure-html/surv-parametric-checks-1.png)

After selecting a distribution, fit crude and adjusted publication-ready
tables.

``` r

surv_crude <- surv_reg(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  exposures = surv_exposures,
  distribution = loglogistic
)

surv_adjusted <- surv_reg(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  exposures = c(trt, celltype, prior),
  adjust_for = c(age, karno),
  distribution = loglogistic,
  model_stats = TRUE
)

surv_adjusted$table
```

| Characteristic | Adjusted Time Ratio (95% CI) | p-value |
|----|----|----|
| Treatment group |  |  |
| Standard treatment | Ref. |  |
|  Test treatment | 0.95 (0.66–1.37) | 0.771 |
| Cancer cell type |  |  |
| Squamous | Ref. |  |
|  Small cell | 0.51 (0.31–0.81) | 0.005 |
|  Adenocarcinoma | 0.48 (0.28–0.80) | 0.005 |
|  Large cell | 1.01 (0.60–1.71) | 0.968 |
| Prior therapy |  |  |
| No | Ref. |  |
|  Yes | 1.07 (0.71–1.62) | 0.740 |
| Abbreviations: Time Ratio = exponentiated accelerated failure time coefficient; CI = Confidence Interval. |  |  |
| Distribution: loglogistic. |  |  |
| Ref. = reference category. |  |  |
| Adjusted for Age and Karnofsky performance score |  |  |

``` r

surv_adjusted$model_stats
```

    ##      model distribution      AIC      BIC    logLik     scale events   n
    ## 1      trt  loglogistic 1449.511 1464.111 -719.7554 0.6186080    128 137
    ## 2 celltype  loglogistic 1438.331 1458.771 -712.1656 0.5796411    128 137
    ## 3    prior  loglogistic 1449.486 1464.086 -719.7429 0.6178590    128 137

Parametric survival models use the same interaction grammar and display
Adjusted Time Ratio (95% CI) when adjustment or multivariable modelling
is used.

``` r

surv_interaction <- surv_reg(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  exposures = trt,
  adjust_for = c(age, karno),
  interaction = trt*prior,
  distribution = loglogistic
)

surv_interaction$table
```

| Characteristic | Adjusted Time Ratio (95% CI) | p-value |
|----|----|----|
| Treatment group |  |  |
| Standard treatment | Ref. |  |
|  Test treatment | 0.84 (0.55–1.30) | 0.444 |
|  Treatment group: Test treatment x Prior therapy: Yes | 1.52 (0.66–3.47) | 0.323 |
| Abbreviations: Time Ratio = exponentiated accelerated failure time coefficient; CI = Confidence Interval. |  |  |
| Distribution: loglogistic. |  |  |
| Ref. = reference category. |  |  |
| Adjusted for Age and Karnofsky performance score |  |  |
| Model includes interaction term: trt\*prior |  |  |

## 6. Predict Survival Probabilities

[`surv_predict()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/surv_predict.md)
turns a fitted parametric survival model into predicted survival
probabilities at selected follow-up times for a profile.

``` r

surv_predict(
  model = surv_adjusted$models$trt,
  newdata = data.frame(
    trt = factor("Test treatment", levels = levels(lung_data$trt)),
    age = 60,
    karno = 70
  ),
  times = c(90, 180, 365)
)$table
```

| Profile | trt | age | karno | Time | Predicted survival | Model distribution |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 1 | Test treatment | 60 | 70 | 90.0 | 54.5% | loglogistic |
| 1 | Test treatment | 60 | 70 | 180.0 | 28.1% | loglogistic |
| 1 | Test treatment | 60 | 70 | 365.0 | 11.1% | loglogistic |
| Model-based predictions from a parametric survival regression model. Distribution: loglogistic. Predictions depend on the supplied profile and model specification. |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Predicted survival probabilities {.table .cl-22b5030c
quarto-disable-processing="true"}

## 7. Visualise And Export Model Results

The survival model outputs work with the same downstream tools used for
other regression tables.

``` r

plot_reg_combine(
  cox_crude,
  cox_adjusted,
  show_ref = FALSE,
  title_uni = "Crude HR",
  title_multi = "Adjusted HR"
)
```

![](survival-analysis_files/figure-html/surv-visualise-export-1.png)

``` r

surv_forest_data <- forest_df(cox_crude, cox_adjusted, desc = lung_summary)

forest_reg(
  surv_forest_data,
  xlim = list(c(0.25, 8), c(0.25, 8)),
  ticks_at = list(c(0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8), c(0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8)),
  quiet = TRUE
)
```

![](survival-analysis_files/figure-html/surv-visualise-export-2.png)

If forest plot x-axis labels overlap, set `xlim` and `ticks_at`. If the
confidence-interval plot panel is too narrow or too wide, tune
`ci_col_width`. For very wide descriptive-plus-crude-plus-adjusted
tables, export using a wider graphics device or Word canvas.
