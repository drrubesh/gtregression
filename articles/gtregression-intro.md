## gtregression

**Publication-ready regression tables and plots for real-world health
data.**

`gtregression` helps you fit, adjust, stratify, visualise, and export
regression results with approachable R syntax. It supports logistic,
log-binomial, Poisson, robust Poisson, negative binomial, Cox survival,
parametric survival, and linear regression. `flextable` is the default
table engine, so outputs are Word-friendly from the start; `format = gt`
remains available for HTML-first workflows.

### What You Can Make

- Clean descriptive tables.
- Univariable and multivariable regression tables.
- Adjusted models with clear footnotes.
- Stratified regression outputs.
- Kaplan-Meier curves, survival summaries, Cox models, and parametric
  survival models.
- Forest plots and publication-style forest tables.
- Model diagnostics, model selection, confounding, and interaction
  checks.
- HTML, PDF, PNG, and Word outputs.

### What Powers the Package

`gtregression` is a readable interface over standard R modelling and
reporting packages. The fitted models remain available inside the
returned objects, so users can inspect the analysis behind the displayed
table.

| Area | Core packages used |
|----|----|
| Data handling | `dplyr`, `purrr`, `tibble`, `rlang` |
| Regression and survival models | `stats`, `MASS`, `survival`, `risks`, `logistf` |
| Robust inference and model tidying | `sandwich`, `lmtest`, `broom`, `broom.helpers` |
| Tables and Word output | `flextable`, `officer`, `gt` |
| Plots and forest plots | `ggplot2`, `patchwork`, `forestploter`, `scales` |

### Install

``` r

install.packages("gtregression")

# Development version
devtools::install_github("ThinkDenominator/gtregression")
```

### Prepare Example Data

The articles use `data_birthwt`, a small built-in dataset that is easy
to learn with.

``` r

library(gtregression)
library(dplyr)

data("data_birthwt", package = "gtregression")

birthwt_data <- data_birthwt |>
  mutate(
    race = factor(race, levels = c(1, 2, 3),
                  labels = c("White", "Black", "Other")),
    smoke = factor(smoke, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    ht = factor(ht, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    ui = factor(ui, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    low = factor(low, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Normal BW", "Low BW")),
    ptl_cat = ifelse(ptl > 0, "Yes", "No"),
    ftv_cat = case_when(
      ftv == 0 ~ "None",
      ftv == 1 ~ "One",
      ftv >= 2 ~ "Two or more"
    )
  ) |>
  mutate(
    ptl_cat = factor(ptl_cat, levels = c("No", "Yes")),
    ftv_cat = factor(ftv_cat, levels = c("None", "One", "Two or more"))
  )

birthwt_exposures <- c(
  "age", "lwt", "race", "smoke", "ht", "ui", "ptl_cat", "ftv_cat"
)

attr(birthwt_data$age, "label") <- "Maternal age"
attr(birthwt_data$lwt, "label") <- "Maternal weight"
attr(birthwt_data$race, "label") <- "Maternal race"
attr(birthwt_data$smoke, "label") <- "Smoking during pregnancy"
attr(birthwt_data$ht, "label") <- "Hypertension"
attr(birthwt_data$ui, "label") <- "Uterine irritability"
attr(birthwt_data$ptl_cat, "label") <- "Previous preterm labour"
attr(birthwt_data$ftv_cat, "label") <- "First trimester visits"
```
