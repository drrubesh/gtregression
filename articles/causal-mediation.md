# Causal Mediation Analysis

Mediation analysis asks whether part of an exposure-outcome association
may pass through an intermediate variable. In health research, that
question is usually interesting only after the clinical story, temporal
order, and likely confounding structure have already been considered.

`gtregression` provides a compact workflow for:

- fitting the mediator and outcome models;
- estimating total, direct, indirect, and proportion mediated effects;
- displaying a publication-style table;
- drawing a simple mediation path diagram.

The output is deliberately transparent. It is a model-based aid to
interpretation, not proof of causality by itself.

## Example Question

This article uses `data_diabetes_mediation`, a teaching dataset based on
a diabetes risk profile. The example question is:

> Does plasma glucose explain part of the association between obesity
> and diabetes?

``` r

library(gtregression)
library(dplyr)

data("data_diabetes_mediation", package = "gtregression")

dissect(data_diabetes_mediation)
```

| Variable | Type | Missing (%) | Unique | Levels | Compatibility | Hint |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| diabetes | factor | 0% | 2 | No, Yes | compatible | Factor variable can be used as categorical. |
| obesity | factor | 0% | 2 | No, Yes | compatible | Factor variable can be used as categorical. |
| glucose | numeric | 0% | 90 | - | compatible | Numeric variable can be used as continuous. |
| bmi | numeric | 0% | 200 | - | compatible | Numeric variable can be used as continuous. |
| age | numeric | 0% | 49 | - | compatible | Numeric variable can be used as continuous. |
| blood_pressure | numeric | 0% | 37 | - | compatible | Numeric variable can be used as continuous. |
| pregnancies | numeric | 0% | 14 | - | compatible | Numeric variable can be used as continuous. |
| diabetes_pedigree | numeric | 0% | 352 | - | compatible | Numeric variable can be used as continuous. |
| Screening aid only; review coding, missingness, sparse levels, and study context before modeling. |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Logistic Outcome

For a binary outcome, use `outcome_approach = logit`. The effects are
reported as predicted probability differences, which are often easier to
explain than odds ratios in a mediation table.

For final analyses, use a larger number of bootstrap simulations such as
`sims = 500` or `sims = 1000`. The article uses a smaller value to keep
the example quick to run.

``` r

diabetes_med <- mediation_analysis(
  data = data_diabetes_mediation,
  exposure = obesity,
  mediator = glucose,
  outcome = diabetes,
  covariates = c(age, blood_pressure, pregnancies, diabetes_pedigree),
  outcome_approach = logit,
  sims = 100,
  seed = 123
)

diabetes_med
```

The returned object keeps the table body, fitted models, bootstrap
draws, and exposure comparison values available for checking.

``` r

diabetes_med$table_body
```

## Path Diagram

[`plot_mediation()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/plot_mediation.md)
draws the exposure, mediator, outcome, and the direct and indirect
paths.

``` r

plot_mediation(diabetes_med)
```

![](causal-mediation_files/figure-html/mediation-plot-1.png)

If the figure is being used only to explain the causal structure, hide
the estimates.

``` r

plot_mediation(diabetes_med, show_estimates = FALSE)
```

![](causal-mediation_files/figure-html/mediation-plot-no-estimates-1.png)

## Quoted Names

Quoted column names and stored character vectors work too. This is
useful inside scripts, functions, and Shiny-style workflows.

``` r

exposure_var <- "obesity"
mediator_var <- "glucose"
outcome_var <- "diabetes"
covariate_vars <- c(
  "age", "blood_pressure", "pregnancies", "diabetes_pedigree"
)

med_quoted <- mediation_analysis(
  data = data_diabetes_mediation,
  exposure = exposure_var,
  mediator = mediator_var,
  outcome = outcome_var,
  covariates = covariate_vars,
  outcome_approach = "logit",
  sims = 100,
  seed = 456
)

med_quoted
```

## Linear Outcome

For a continuous outcome, use `outcome_approach = linear`. In this
example, the outcome is body mass index, so the effects are reported as
mean differences.

``` r

med_linear <- mediation_analysis(
  data = data_diabetes_mediation,
  exposure = obesity,
  mediator = glucose,
  outcome = bmi,
  covariates = c(age, blood_pressure, pregnancies, diabetes_pedigree),
  outcome_approach = linear,
  sims = 100,
  seed = 789
)

med_linear
```

``` r

plot_mediation(med_linear)
```

![](causal-mediation_files/figure-html/mediation-linear-plot-1.png)

## How To Report

A compact reporting sentence might look like this:

> In this teaching analysis, plasma glucose explained part of the
> model-based obesity-diabetes association. Effects were estimated on
> the predicted probability difference scale using logistic outcome
> models and bootstrap confidence intervals.

The table footnote records the exposure comparison, mediator, outcome,
bootstrap replicates, and adjustment variables so readers can see what
was estimated.

## What Not To Claim

Mediation estimates should not be treated as automatic causal proof. A
cautious analysis should consider:

- whether the exposure clearly precedes the mediator;
- whether the mediator clearly precedes the outcome;
- whether exposure-mediator, mediator-outcome, and exposure-outcome
  confounding have been handled;
- whether post-exposure confounders are present;
- whether the model forms are plausible;
- whether a DAG or subject-matter argument supports the causal
  interpretation.

Use the table and plot to support interpretation after that thinking has
been done.
