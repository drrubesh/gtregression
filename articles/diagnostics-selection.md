# Diagnostics and Model Selection

Before the final table goes into a manuscript, check the model. These
helpers keep diagnostics close to the regression workflow. They are
screening aids: interpret them with the study design, clinical or
subject-matter judgement, and the diagnostics from the fitted model.

``` r

library(gtregression)
library(dplyr)

data("data_birthwt", package = "gtregression")

birthwt_data <- data_birthwt |>
  mutate(
    race = factor(race, levels = c(1, 2, 3),
                  labels = c("White", "Black", "Other")),
    smoke = factor(smoke, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    ht = factor(ht, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    ui = factor(ui, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    low = factor(low, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Normal BW", "Low BW")),
    ptl_cat = factor(ifelse(ptl > 0, "Yes", "No"), levels = c("No", "Yes"))
  )

exposures <- c("age", "lwt", "race", "smoke", "ht", "ui", "ptl_cat")
```

## Convergence Screening

Use
[`check_convergence()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/check_convergence.md)
before interpreting model estimates, especially for log-binomial and
small or sparse binary-outcome models. A non-converged model is a
fitting warning, not a finding.

``` r

check_convergence(
  data = birthwt_data,
  exposures = exposures,
  outcome = low,
  approach = logit,
  multivariate = TRUE
)
```

| Exposure | Model | Converged | Max fitted value |
|----|----|----|----|
| age + lwt + race + smoke + ht + ui + ptl_cat | logit | Yes | 0.880 |
| Screening aid only; inspect non-convergence, impossible fitted values, and model specification before interpreting estimates. |  |  |  |

Convergence check {.table .cl-08e32198 quarto-disable-processing="true"}

For risk-ratio workflows, this same check helps users decide whether a
log-binomial model fitted cleanly or whether a robust Poisson approach
may be a more practical sensitivity analysis.

``` r

check_convergence(
  data = birthwt_data,
  exposures = c("smoke", "ht", "ui", "ptl_cat"),
  outcome = low,
  approach = logbinomial,
  multivariate = TRUE
)
```

| Exposure | Model | Converged | Max fitted value |
|----|----|----|----|
| smoke + ht + ui + ptl_cat | logbinomial | No |  |
| Screening aid only; inspect non-convergence, impossible fitted values, and model specification before interpreting estimates. |  |  |  |

Convergence check {.table .cl-0914493a quarto-disable-processing="true"}

## Collinearity Screening

[`check_collinearity()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/check_collinearity.md)
reports VIF-style diagnostics for multivariable models. High VIF values
are prompts to inspect coding, overlap between predictors, and the
scientific purpose of the model.

``` r

birthwt_multi <- multi_reg(
  data = birthwt_data,
  outcome = low,
  exposures = exposures,
  approach = logit
)

check_collinearity(birthwt_multi, format = gt)
```

| Collinearity check |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| Variable | VIF | Interpretation |
| age | 1.04 | No collinearity |
| lwt | 1.14 | No collinearity |
| race | 1.11 | No collinearity |
| smoke | 1.16 | No collinearity |
| ht | 1.08 | No collinearity |
| ui | 1.02 | No collinearity |
| ptl_cat | 1.05 | No collinearity |
| Screening aid only; interpret VIF with model purpose, coding choices, sample size, and subject-matter knowledge. |  |  |

Adjusted-mode
[`multi_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/multi_reg.md)
objects contain one model per exposure. The collinearity output keeps
that list structure so each model can be inspected separately.

``` r

birthwt_adjusted <- multi_reg(
  data = birthwt_data,
  outcome = low,
  exposures = c("smoke", "ht", "ui", "ptl_cat"),
  adjust_for = c("age", "lwt", "race"),
  approach = logit
)

check_collinearity(birthwt_adjusted, format = tibble)
```

## Model Fit Plots

[`plot_model_fit()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/plot_model_fit.md)
turns fitted models into quick diagnostic plots. It accepts raw
[`lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html) and
[`glm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/glm.html) objects, and it also works
with models saved inside
[`uni_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/uni_reg.md)
and
[`multi_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/multi_reg.md)
results.

For logistic regression, the calibration plot compares predicted
probabilities with observed event proportions. Points close to the
diagonal line suggest that the model predictions are reasonably aligned
with the observed data. Calibration is usually most useful for
multivariable models because predicted probabilities vary across many
people.

``` r

plot_model_fit(
  birthwt_multi,
  type = calibration,
  bins = 6
)
```

![](diagnostics-selection_files/figure-html/diag-fit-logistic-1.png)

When a
[`uni_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/uni_reg.md)
object contains several models, use `model_name` to choose the exposure
you want to inspect. For a simple binary exposure, calibration may only
show two points because the model has only two fitted probabilities; in
that situation, residual and influence plots are usually more useful.

``` r

birthwt_uni <- uni_reg(
  data = birthwt_data,
  outcome = low,
  exposures = c("age", "lwt", "smoke"),
  approach = logit
)

plot_model_fit(
  birthwt_uni,
  model_name = smoke,
  type = residual
)
```

![](diagnostics-selection_files/figure-html/diag-fit-uni-1.png)

For logistic models, residual plots often form two visible bands. That
is a normal consequence of a 0/1 outcome and should be interpreted as a
screening plot rather than a linear-model residual plot.

For linear regression, `type = all` shows the classic residual, Q-Q,
scale-location, and Cook’s distance views.

``` r

fit_lm <- lm(bwt ~ age + lwt, data = birthwt_data)
plot_model_fit(fit_lm)
```

![](diagnostics-selection_files/figure-html/diag-fit-linear-1.png)

## Proportional Hazards Screening

For Cox models, use
[`check_ph()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/check_ph.md)
before treating hazard ratios as final. It reports Schoenfeld residual
tests from
[`survival::cox.zph()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/cox.zph.html),
including a global test. Small p-values suggest possible
non-proportional hazards and should be reviewed with plots, follow-up
pattern, and clinical judgement.

``` r

data("data_lungcancer", package = "gtregression")

lung_data <- data_lungcancer |>
  mutate(
    trt = factor(trt, levels = c(1, 2),
                 labels = c("Standard treatment", "Test treatment")),
    prior = factor(prior, levels = c(0, 10), labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    celltype = factor(
      celltype,
      levels = c("squamous", "smallcell", "adeno", "large"),
      labels = c("Squamous", "Small cell", "Adenocarcinoma", "Large cell")
    )
  )

cox_fit <- cox_reg(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  exposures = c(trt, celltype, prior),
  adjust_for = c(age, karno)
)
```

``` r

check_ph(cox_fit, format = gt)
```

| Proportional hazards check |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Model | Term | Test | Chi-square | df | p-value | Interpretation |

| Screening aid only. Small p-values suggest possible non-proportional hazards; interpret with Schoenfeld residual plots, follow-up pattern, clinical context, and model purpose. alpha = 0.05; transform = km. |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Use `format = tibble` when you want to inspect or filter the diagnostic
results.

``` r

check_ph(cox_fit, transform = rank, format = tibble)
```

## Stepwise Model Selection

[`compare_models()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/compare_models.md)
is for prespecified candidate models that have already been fitted with
gtregression. It answers a different question from stepwise selection:
“How do these planned models compare?” The inputs should be
[`multi_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/multi_reg.md),
[`cox_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/cox_reg.md),
or
[`surv_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/surv_reg.md)
outputs, not raw [`lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html),
[`glm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/glm.html), `coxph()`, or `survreg()`
objects. This keeps the workflow consistent with the publication-ready
tables created by the package.

``` r

logit_m0 <- multi_reg(
  data = birthwt_data,
  outcome = low,
  exposures = smoke,
  approach = logit
)

logit_m1 <- multi_reg(
  data = birthwt_data,
  outcome = low,
  exposures = c(smoke, age, lwt),
  approach = logit
)

logit_m2 <- multi_reg(
  data = birthwt_data,
  outcome = low,
  exposures = c(smoke, age, lwt, race, ht, ui),
  approach = logit
)

logit_model_comparison <- compare_models(
  logit_m0,
  logit_m1,
  logit_m2,
  model_names = c(
    "Smoking only",
    "Add age and weight",
    "Full clinical model"
  ),
  primary_exposure = smoke,
  format = gt
)

logit_model_comparison$table
```

[TABLE]

The table reports N, number of parameters, AIC, BIC, log-likelihood, and
likelihood-ratio comparisons when `nested = TRUE`. Lower AIC or BIC
identifies better relative fit among the compared models. When
`primary_exposure` is supplied, the table also tracks that effect
estimate and the percentage change across models.

[`compare_models()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/compare_models.md)
automatically checks whether the candidate models appear to use the same
analysis sample. It uses retained row identifiers when the fitted model
stores them; otherwise it compares N and event counts. If the models use
different complete-case samples, the table still displays AIC, BIC,
log-likelihood, and likelihood-ratio statistics for transparency, but
the footer warns that these values should not be interpreted as formal
model-selection criteria across different datasets. In that situation,
use the primary exposure estimate, percentage change, confidence
intervals, and clinical or epidemiological reasoning to judge
robustness.

### Build Candidates in the App

The function API intentionally accepts fitted gtregression objects. In
the gtregression app, **Advanced \> Compare models** provides a guided
layer before that API: choose the shared outcome and approach, name two
to six candidates, and select each candidate’s exposures, adjustment
variables, and optional interaction. The app fits
[`multi_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/multi_reg.md),
[`cox_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/cox_reg.md),
or
[`surv_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/surv_reg.md)
objects and then calls
[`compare_models()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/compare_models.md)
with those objects.

For the birth weight models above, enter *Smoking only*, *Add age and
weight*, and *Full clinical model* as the candidate names, place `smoke`
in the exposure control, and add the corresponding variables under
adjustment. Select `smoke` as the primary exposure to reproduce the
estimate-change columns. The generated code records every fitted model
and is suitable for direct use in an R script.

Candidate order is deliberate. Put the simplest or primary model first
because percentage change is calculated from that model and
likelihood-ratio statistics compare sequential pairs. If the fitted
samples differ, or a sequential pair is not nested, the rendered table
displays only the warning relevant to that comparison. See the
**gtregression App** article for the complete ordinary, Cox, and
parametric survival walkthrough.

For Cox and parametric survival models, fit the candidate models with
[`cox_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/cox_reg.md)
or
[`surv_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/surv_reg.md)
first.
[`compare_models()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/compare_models.md)
then keeps survival-specific columns such as events and Cox concordance.

``` r

cox_m0 <- cox_reg(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  exposures = trt
)

cox_m1 <- cox_reg(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  exposures = trt,
  adjust_for = c(age, karno)
)

cox_m2 <- cox_reg(
  data = lung_data,
  time = time,
  event = status,
  exposures = c(trt, age, karno, celltype, prior),
  multivariable = TRUE
)

cox_model_comparison <- compare_models(
  list(
    "Treatment only" = cox_m0,
    "Add age and performance" = cox_m1,
    "Full clinical model" = cox_m2
  ),
  primary_exposure = trt,
  format = gt
)

cox_model_comparison$table
```

[TABLE]

[`select_models()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/select_models.md)
compares candidate models step by step. It is useful for exploration,
teaching, and sensitivity checks. It should not replace a planned model
based on study design or a causal framework.

``` r

selected <- select_models(
  data = birthwt_data,
  outcome = low,
  exposures = exposures,
  approach = logit,
  direction = forward
)

## What To Inspect

- [`check_convergence()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/check_convergence.md):
  convergence status and maximum fitted probabilities. Use `format = gt`
  or `format = flextable` for viewing tables.
- [`check_collinearity()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/check_collinearity.md):
  VIF and interpretation. Nested model outputs keep their list structure
  when formatted.
- [`plot_model_fit()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/plot_model_fit.md):
  residual, calibration, observed-versus-predicted, and influence plots
  for `lm`/`glm` models and stored
  [`uni_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/uni_reg.md)
  /
  [`multi_reg()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/multi_reg.md)
  fitted models.
- [`check_ph()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/check_ph.md):
  Schoenfeld residual proportional hazards tests for Cox models,
  including term-level and global tests.
- [`compare_models()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/compare_models.md):
  AIC, BIC, log-likelihood, likelihood-ratio tests, sample size, events
  for survival models, and optional primary-exposure tracking for
  gtregression candidate models.
- [`select_models()`](https://gtregression.thinkdenominator.com/reference/select_models.md):
  `$results_table`, `$best_model`, `$all_models`, and `$direction`;
  `$table` is added when `format = gt` or `format = flextable`.
